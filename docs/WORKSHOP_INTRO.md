# Workshop description

Ever wanted to build a chatbot? A robot, that would listen to conversations and be able to respond to keywords and commands?

With Hubot, building a robot is easy - all you need to do is script it's behavior through simple JavaScript.

- Want a sarcastic response when someone uses fancy business words?
- Want to trigger deploys with ChatOps commands in team chat?
- Want to have a bot respond to common questions, such as how to change AD password?
- Want a SecurityBot, that would automatically poke people who issued sensitive commands in productions?

All of this and more is possible. We will introduce Hubot, a simple framework for building Fleep and Hipchat chatbots. Participants will have roughly 90 minutes to build their robot and teach it to do their bidding. You can participate alone, but a team of two to three people with pre-existing idea for a bot is recommended.

## Equipment, software

- Participants with own laptop
- Wall screen or projector for instructor screen-sharing (HDMI)

## Software

- Linux or Mac development environment in laptops. NPM installed, Node 6+ installed
- Recommended: local redis server running for persistence
- Basic JavaScript programming skills from at least one person in the group - language in use will be JS
- IDE / code editor
- Want to verify your environment beforehand? Try to get https://github.com/hubotio/hubot running locally with a shell adapter.

## Target audience

Engineers who write code for the bot will be the main target for this botshop. But there is more in building a good bot than writing Javascript! A good bot has well thought out UX, so interaction designers will find work here. The best bots also communicate concisely and have personality, so copywriters are needed to write funny, engaging, succinct and snarky responses. And of course, an effective bot will also solve some kind of business need, which can only come from an (internal) customer ("Bot Owner").
